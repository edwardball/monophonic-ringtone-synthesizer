Monophonic Ringtone Synthesizer
===============================

You can play the Monophonic Ringtone Synthesizer in three ways.

First, you can press the keys on your Qwerty keyboard.
For example A, W, S, E play the notes C, C#, D, D# and so on.	

Secondly, you can click the notes with your mouse (or tap with your finger).

Thirdly, if you are using Chrome, you can connect a MIDI keyboard, and play
via that method. If it doesn't work first time, try refreshing or re-connecting.

There's a live version of this synth over at [http://outputchannel.com/monophonic-ringtone-synthesizer/](http://outputchannel.com/monophonic-ringtone-synthesizer/)
